# Discord-Exploits
A program for creating exploited media files for discord written in Go.

## Usage
###### discord-exploits is a command line utility, meaning you have to run it through a terminal!

### Getting Help

`discord-exploits -h` will show you what commands can be used and what you have to do

### Creating an Expanding Video file

`discord-exploits -m <mode> -i <input file>` 

the mode `e` stands for expanding video duration

the mode `n` stands for negative video duration

the mode `0` or `z` stands for video with 0s duration

the mode `v` stands for virus image

The Program only supports `webm` files for video and `png` files for images

##### The file will be saved with a random file name in the directory in which you ran the command
##### You can use [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to convert a video to .webm or to convert an image to png (better than online converters)
##### The "virus" image may get flagged by windows defender and will get removed. to restore the file, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & Threat protection and restore the file

### Other file formats 
If you want to run this program with other file types like `mp4` and `jpg` directly, make sure you have FFmpeg installed and on your path as the program uses it to transcode the file in those cases.
